The web-based application described in this project uses machine learning algorithms, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network, to detect whether an uploaded XML file is infected or clean. The system is built using Python as the backend language, Django as the web framework, and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for design purposes. The backend database used is MySQL. The project highlights the increasing use of machine learning in cybersecurity to detect malware and protect against threats. This is a web-based application that leverages ML algorithms to detect the malicious nature of XML permissions files extracted from Android applications. By analyzing the permissions requested by an application, the web application determines whether the corresponding permissions file is malicious or not. This innovative approach enhances the security of Android systems by proactively identifying potential threats and protecting users from malware infiltration.
